A Ruby/Sinatra and D3.js app that could make a great visual companion for interactive journalism

Morty is a Sinatra app based on the 2017 Mortality Report, a Summary of Vital Statistics for the City of New York. The app scrapes the report to show death rates for individual neighborhoods, ranked. Development still in progress.
